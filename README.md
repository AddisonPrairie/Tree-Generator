## Tree Generator with Web Assembly & WebGL

See the demo [here](https://addisonprairie.github.io/Tree-Generator/).

The tree generation code is written in C++ and compiled to Web Assembly. The rendering is done in WebGL, with some glue JavaScript code. The generation algorithm is loosely based off [this paper](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/selforg.sig2009.html) and works by simulating computation for light.
